LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://many.link/). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplateâ€”we just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services. ðŸ˜Š

This is my personalised littlelink site deployed own my own SMB home server (ODROID XM2)
